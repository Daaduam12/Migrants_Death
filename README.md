The creation of the Migrants' Death Project involved utilizing data sourced from http://www.themigrantsfile.com. This dataset encompasses all documented events related to migrant fatalities during attempts to reach or remain in Europe from the years 2000 to 2016. The data was visualized to provide a comprehensive understanding of when, where, and in which years these events transpired, shedding light on their global impact. This project constitutes a component of the academic requirements for a Visualization Class (DSSA) at Stockton University. (December,2019)
